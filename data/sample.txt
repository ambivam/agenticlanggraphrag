This is a sample document for the MCP chatbot.
        The chatbot uses multiple sources to answer questions:
        1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with FAISS
        2. MySQL database queries
        3. Web search using SerpAPI
        
        The system tries each source in sequence until it finds a good answer.
